# 📜 JavaScript Notes & Practice

This folder contains foundational to intermediate topics in JavaScript — the language that brings websites to life.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This directory covers key JavaScript concepts and programming paradigms, including:

- 💡 **Basics** — Variables, data types, operators, control flow  
- 🔄 **Callbacks & Array Methods** — Handling asynchronous code, manipulating arrays  
- 🛠️ **Functions** — Declaration, expressions, scopes, closures  
- 🌐 **DOM (Document Object Model)** — Interacting with HTML elements dynamically  
- 🏗️ **Prototype, Class & OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** — Understanding objects, inheritance, and modern class syntax

## 📝 Important Notes & Tips

### Basics
- Always use `let` and `const` instead of `var` for block scoping and immutability where possible.  
- Understand **hoisting**: declarations are hoisted but assignments are not.  
- Use strict equality (`===`) to avoid unexpected type coercion bugs.

### Callbacks & Array Methods
- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments — essential for asynchronous programming.  
- Master array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()` for cleaner, functional-style code.  
- Understand the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution.

### Functions
- Functions can be declared, expressed, or arrow functions — each has unique behaviors, especially with `this`.  
- Closures allow functions to remember the scope in which they were created — powerful for data privacy and callbacks.  
- Default parameters and rest/spread operators improve flexibility.

### DOM
- The DOM lets you **query**, **manipulate**, and **listen to events** on HTML elements.  
- Use methods like `querySelector()`, `addEventListener()`, and properties like `innerText`, `classList` effectively.  
- Avoid manipulating the DOM excessively; batch updates or use frameworks/libraries when projects scale.

### Prototype, Class & OOP
- JavaScript’s inheritance model is prototype-based — every object has a prototype chain.  
- ES6 introduced `class` syntax as syntactic sugar over prototypes — making OOP more familiar.  
- Use classes and constructors for reusable object blueprints, encapsulating data and behavior.
