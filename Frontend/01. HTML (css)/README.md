## 📝 Important Notes & Tips

### Basics
- Always start with a proper HTML5 document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`) to improve accessibility and SEO.  
- Separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) for better maintainability.

### Forms
- Use appropriate input types (`text`, `email`, `password`, `number`, etc.) for better user experience and validation.  
- Style form elements carefully to maintain usability across browsers — default styles can vary.  
- Remember to associate `<label>` elements with inputs via `for` attributes for accessibility.

### Inheritance
- Many CSS properties inherit from parent elements (e.g., `color`, `font-family`), but some do not (e.g., `margin`, `padding`).  
- Use inheritance to your advantage to reduce redundant styling.  
- Be mindful of specificity and cascading when overriding inherited styles.

### Small Project - Template Page
- This is your playground to combine HTML structure and CSS styling.  
- Focus on clean, readable code and responsive design principles.  
- Practice using external stylesheets and organizing CSS for scalability.
