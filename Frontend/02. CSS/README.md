## 📝 Important Notes & Tips

### Box Model
- Remember that the **total element size** = width + padding + border + margin.  
- Use `box-sizing: border-box;` to include padding and border in the element’s declared width/height. It helps avoid unexpected sizing issues.  
- Margins can collapse vertically between adjacent elements — plan your spacing accordingly.

### Flexbox
- Flexbox is great for **one-dimensional layouts** (row or column). Use it to align and distribute space efficiently.  
- Always define the flex container with `display: flex;`. Use properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap` to control layout behavior.  
- Use `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` for flexible sizing of children.

### Selectors
- Use **specificity** wisely — inline styles > IDs > classes > elements. Avoid overusing IDs to keep CSS maintainable.  
- Group selectors when styles overlap to reduce repetition.  
- Use pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:focus`) and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for interactive and decorative effects without extra markup.

### Useful Properties
- `transition` and `transform` can create smooth, performant animations without JavaScript.  
- `position` property (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`) controls element positioning and stacking context — understand their differences well.  
- Use CSS variables (`--variable-name`) for reusable values and theming.

### Bootstrap
- Bootstrap is a powerful **mobile-first framework** that speeds up development.  
- Use its grid system and utility classes for fast, responsive layouts.  
- Customize Bootstrap via Sass variables if you want to adjust default styles.
