## ✅ Goals

- Understand **server-side** architecture 🧠
- Create, read, update, and delete data from databases 💾
- Build and document **RESTful APIs** 🌐
- Implement user **authentication and authorization** 🔐
- Deploy backend apps to the cloud ☁️

## 🚀 Learning Path

1. `nodejs-basics/` – Setup, file system, modules, async programming
2. `express-framework/` – Routes, middleware, error handling
3. `databases/` – SQL vs NoSQL databases (MongoDB)
4. `auth-systems/` – JWT, sessions, hashing passwords
5. `projects/` – Real-life mini apps (e.g. blog API, user auth, etc.)
