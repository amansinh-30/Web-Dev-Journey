# 🧩 Node.js Notes & Practice

This folder contains essential notes, examples, and practice projects to help understand **Node.js** — a powerful JavaScript runtime built for building fast, scalable, and efficient server-side applications.

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

This directory focuses on core Node.js concepts, server fundamentals, and practical usage, including:

- ⚙️ **Introduction to Node.js** — What it is, why it's used  
- 📁 **Core Modules** — `fs`, `http`, `path`, `os`, etc.  
- 📦 **npm (Node Package Manager)** — Installing and managing dependencies  
- 🛠️ **Module System** — CommonJS, exports/imports  
- 🌐 **Creating a Server** — Using the native `http` module  
- 🧵 **Event-Driven Architecture** — Event loop, callbacks, async patterns  
- 🔄 **File System Interaction** — Reading/writing files with `fs`  
- 🧰 **Tools & Packages** — Using tools like `nodemon`, and packages like `dotenv`

## 📝 Important Notes & Tips

### Introduction to Node.js
- Node.js allows you to run JavaScript **outside the browser**, on the server.
- Built on **Chrome’s V8 engine**, it's designed for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
- Ideal for **real-time applications**, REST APIs, command-line tools, and microservices.

### Core Modules
- `fs` for interacting with the file system  
- `http` to create basic web servers  
- `path` to manage and resolve file paths  
- `os` to get operating system-level information  
- Use `require()` to load these built-in modules.

### npm & Packages
- `npm` comes bundled with Node.js — it’s used to install third-party libraries.
- Use `npm init` to create a `package.json` that manages your project metadata.
- Run `npm install <package>` to add external libraries (e.g., `express`, `dotenv`).

### Module System
- Use `module.exports` to expose functions/variables from a file.
- Import using `require()` in another file.
- Node uses the **CommonJS** module system by default (not ES modules unless configured).

### Creating a Server
- Use the native `http` module to create a server with `http.createServer()`.
- Handle requests/responses manually using `req` and `res` objects.
- For scalable development, frameworks like **Express** simplify routing and middleware.

### Event-Driven & Async Patterns
- Node is **non-blocking** and **event-driven** by design.
- Async operations use **callbacks**, **Promises**, or `async/await`.
- Understand the **event loop** — it enables concurrency without multi-threading.
